## Community contributions

Awesome Phone Call Agents is an early community hub for developers and workflow builders creating reusable phone-call workflows for AI agents. CALL-E SDKs, provider APIs, authentication, call execution, and provider-side controls belong upstream with CALL-E itself. This repository focuses on the community artifacts around those primitives: Agent Skills, workflow plugins, user-facing apps, examples, templates, and safety patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> New here? Start with the [`call-reminder`](skills/call-reminder/) and [`google-form-callback`](skills/google-form-callback/) skills, use [`outbound-call-skill-creator`](skills/outbound-call-skill-creator/) when you need to generate a focused outbound workflow skill, try the [`python/batch-runner`](apps/python/batch-runner/) app, and read [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for open community directions.

| Contribution area | Good examples | Where to contribute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Skills | Customer callbacks, appointment confirmation, lead qualification, order exception follow-up, service dispatch, incident escalation | `skills/` |
| Workflow Plugins | Dify tools, n8n nodes, Zapier actions, HubSpot workflow actions, Feishu/Lark automation nodes | `plugins/` |
| User-facing Apps | Call chat, call review console, call scheduler UI, customer callback app, business call workbench | `apps/` |

The community roadmap is a direction guide, not a fixed release plan. Small examples, platform notes, workflow sketches, templates, and focused demos are all useful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phone-call workflows can create real-world side effects. Please keep examples explicit, easy to inspect, safe to try without a real call when possible, and clear about phone numbers, credentials, scheduling, cancellation, and result handling.

## Why this repository exists

AI agents increasingly need to turn phone calls into reusable workflows: reminders, follow-ups, appointment coordination, provider-specific call adapters, scheduler integrations, and safety checks that other agents can install or adapt. Each entry should help an agent package, schedule, execute, or safely operate a real phone-call workflow — not act as a generic voice-agent product, telephony vendor directory, or call-center software list.

This repository focuses on three principles:

1. **Portability**: skills, apps, and adapters should be useful across agent hosts when possible.
2. **Provider separation**: the phone-call provider should place or create calls; the host scheduler should handle recurrence.
3. **Safety by default**: phone numbers, consent, credentials, and medical, legal, financial, or emergency boundaries must be handled explicitly.

## CLI reference

CALL-E CLI parameters and command flags are documented in [`cli-reference.md`](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/call-e-integrations/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/cli-reference.md).

## Templates

### Skill folder template

Use this Agent Skills folder pattern:

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
├── scripts/
└── assets/
```

### App directory template

Use `apps/` for runnable tools and demo apps:

```text
apps/
├── python/
│   └── app-name/
└── typescript/
    └── app-name/
```

Every app that can place a call or create a recurring job must document setup, side effects, cancellation, credential handling, and dry-run or preview behavior.

### Plugin directory template

Use `plugins/` for no-code and low-code workflow-platform plugins:

```text
plugins/
└── plugin-name/
    ├── README.md
    ├── manifest-or-config-file
    └── examples/
```

Every plugin should document supported triggers or actions, required inputs, side effects, credential handling, dry-run or preview behavior, and cancellation or rollback behavior when it can create calls or recurring jobs.

### README list entry template

```markdown
- [Project Name](https://example.com) - One sentence explaining why this is useful for AI-agent phone-call workflows.
```

Keep descriptions short, specific, factual, and directly tied to packaging, scheduling, executing, or safely operating AI-agent phone-call tasks.

Good: `- [call-reminder](skills/call-reminder/) - Scheduler wrapper skill for recurring CALL-E phone-call reminders.`
Avoid: `- [call-reminder](skills/call-reminder/) - A great tool for calling people!` (marketing language, no indication of what it does or how it fits the AI-agent workflow)

## Resource list

This project is an awesome list for AI-agent phone-call workflows. Add resources only when they directly help agents package, schedule, execute, or safely operate phone-call tasks.

### Skills

- [`accesscall`](skills/accesscall/) - Phone-based accessibility intake for VPAT 2.4/Section 508 audits. Run `npm install` in `skills/accesscall/` before using `scripts/format-to-vpat.js`, or it fails with `Cannot find module 'jszip'`.
- [`appointment-confirm`](skills/appointment-confirm/) - Confirms one existing appointment by phone, captures yes/no plus time as structured JSON, and leaves calendar writes to a human.
- [`candidate-availability-call`](skills/candidate-availability-call/) - Recruiting coordination skill that confirms candidate interview availability by phone, returns evidence-backed time windows, and leaves scheduling commitments to a human.
- [`call-reminder`](skills/call-reminder/) - Scheduler wrapper skill for recurring CALL-E phone-call reminders.
- [`callparity-claimkill`](skills/callparity-claimkill/) - ClaimKill (CallParity) compiles the next CALL-E call as a leak-scored refute of a quoted claim; pytest runs on fixtures with zero live calls.
- [`customer-onboarding-call`](skills/customer-onboarding-call/) - Welcome-call skill that turns a new signup into at most one conversation, a consent-gated structured result, and a CRM follow-up task, with evidence-backed dispositions, ordered outcome classification, per-attempt idempotency, and cancellable retries.
- [`deployment-approval-call`](skills/deployment-approval-call/) - Spoken, code-verified human approval before an agent or pipeline does something irreversible.
- [`emergency-dispatch-relay`](skills/emergency-dispatch-relay/) - Experimental, preview-first human-confirmed notification relay with an optional authorized exercise call and advisory unit-response output; not an autonomous emergency-dispatch system.
- [`holdline`](skills/holdline/) - Asks one question of many places by phone in a single dispatch and returns only the fields the transcript supports, flagging values a call reports for questions it never asked.
- [`voice-preflight`](skills/voice-preflight/) - Hear a call task spoken by your own text-to-speech provider before a real person does, then refuse a script whose critical line would not survive being spoken.
- [`dollar-consent-first-callback`](skills/dollar-consent-first-callback/) - Consent-first owner escalation after a local safety gate blocks an extreme-risk developer action; call results never grant destructive permission.
- [`forgerelay-supplier-clarification`](skills/forgerelay-supplier-clarification/) - Safe, approval-gated CALL-E workflow for collecting missing manufacturing RFQ details from authorized supplier contacts.
- [`human-context-handoff`](skills/human-context-handoff/) - Ask a verified human one bounded product, workflow, preference, or operations question, then resume an agent only from a durable structured result.
- [`holdfast`](skills/holdfast/) - Delegate the phone calls people dread — IVR menus, hold queues, recorded hotlines. Navigates phone trees with DTMF, waits through hold, returns transcript-verified results, and contributes discovered phone-tree paths back to a shared IVR map library so the next call is faster.
- [`language-bridge-call`](skills/language-bridge-call/) - Cross-language relay for CALL-E: one call to the recipient in their language, one call back to the requester in theirs, returning an agreed window or a fail-closed handoff.
- [`labline-critical-result`](skills/labline-critical-result/) - Safety-bounded CALL-E workflow for verified critical laboratory-result delivery with exact read-back, fail-closed disclosure rules, and human-owned clinical judgment.
- [`google-form-callback`](skills/google-form-callback/) - Google Form response workflow for safe one-off callback calls with dry-runs, scheduling plans, and Sheets writeback. See the [workflow guide](docs/google-form-callback/).
- [`linecanary-monitor`](skills/linecanary-monitor/) - Synthetic monitoring for phone lines and deployed voice agents: scheduled test calls, structured assertions, baseline diffing, and CI gating via the linecanary app.
- [`mobilize`](skills/mobilize/) - Get a required number of confirmed responses from a consented pool within a deadline by dispatching parallel wave calls that stop the moment the need is met.
- [`outbound-call-skill-creator`](skills/outbound-call-skill-creator/) - Creator skill for generating focused outbound phone-call workflow skills from Google Forms, TikTok Ads, Notion, Airtable, local CSV files, or custom sources.
- [`holdfor-post-visit-followup`](skills/holdfor-post-visit-followup/) - Post-appointment check-in call for an older patient that books nothing: it returns five enumerated answers and one verbatim quote to a review queue, stops the call rather than answer anything clinical, and places a second call into the practice's own booking line only after a named human grants a bounded authority.
- [`metapelet-elder-checkin`](skills/metapelet-elder-checkin/) - Consent-based outbound wellbeing check-in for older adults using the MetaPelet non-medical companion persona; returns mood, topics, and repeat-call interest.
- [`standby`](skills/standby/) - Fill one open shift from a standby roster with a strictly sequential call cascade that stops at the first acceptance, so a single slot cannot be double-booked; handles no-answer retry passes, callbacks, quiet hours, a shift-start cutoff, and holds the cascade for human reconciliation when a call cannot be read.
- [`service-dispatch-call`](skills/service-dispatch-call/) - Service dispatch workflow that asks a vendor about availability, ETA, and cost, returns a schema-validated result, and routes any commitment to human approval.
- [`veyra-campaign-planner`](skills/veyra-campaign-planner/) - Turns a plain-language outbound process into an approval-ready Veyra campaign brief, reviews the generated workflow, and gates live dispatch behind an exact recipient preview.
- [`calle-script-advisor`](skills/calle-script-advisor/) - Drafts and lints CALL-E call task text and result schemas for clarity, safety, and extraction quality before a call is placed.
- [`calle-invoice-recovery`](skills/calle-invoice-recovery/) - Invoice-recovery conversation and safety reference with a no-call preview; live dispatch and human approval are host responsibilities. See the [operator guide](docs/calle-invoice-recovery/).

- [`verify-by-phone`](skills/verify-by-phone/) - Single disclosed verification call that checks a directory listing against the published line, grounds every answer in a transcript span, and abstains instead of guessing when the call does not establish one.
- [`verity-verification-core`](skills/verity-verification-core/) - Gates a CALL-E phone task's `task_completed` claim behind an independent transcript read-back before any real-world action; catches a mid-sentence self-correction, voicemail, or a value the caller never confirmed, returns ALLOW or BLOCK plus the exact value to re-confirm on a second channel, and is deterministic, no-network, and fail-closed.
- [`call-state-reconciler`](skills/call-state-reconciler/) - Works out what actually happened to a call by reading the call task, its attempts and its event stream together, and names the field behind each conclusion. Covers the states where the platform's own signals disagree.
- [`call-summarizer`](skills/call-summarizer/) - Post-call analysis skill that turns a completed CALL-E transcript into a masked, actionable brief with a one-line outcome, extracted action items with owners and due dates, caller sentiment, and a one-way caller fingerprint for de-duplicating repeat callers.
- [`ringer-consumer-tasks`](skills/ringer-consumer-tasks/) - Compose and safely place the dreaded consumer phone calls (bill negotiation, cancellation, refund, booking, quote comparison, inquiry) as CALL-E tasks with strict result schemas, dry-run-by-default previews, and human-in-the-loop decision authority.
- [`incident-escalation-call`](skills/incident-escalation-call/) - Walks an on-call escalation ladder one phone call at a time and records an acknowledgement only when an owner and an ETA are both quoted by words the recipient spoke, then re-reads the call over a second transport before the incident is reported as owned.
- [`hifi-hotel-negotiator`](skills/hifi-hotel-negotiator/) - Autonomous voice AI agent skill for hotel procurement, direct-booking rate negotiation, and reservation confirmation over the phone using CALL-E.
- [`partline-part-sourcing`](skills/partline-part-sourcing/) - Preview-first industrial replacement-part sourcing that calls approved suppliers for exact part identity, quantity and shipping cutoffs, then ranks evidence-backed matches and leaves purchase and alternate approval to a human.
- [`concord-policy-audit`](skills/concord-policy-audit/) - Calls the branches an operator owns, judges each spoken answer against a written policy rubric compiled into the CALL-E result schema, and returns a branch-level gap register that carries no field capable of identifying the person who answered.
- [`ledger-collections-call`](skills/ledger-collections-call/) - HITL outbound collections call from overdue JSON (E.164, integer minor units, region); CALL-E `create` + poll; structured promise out; dry-run default; never posts to unsupported regions (including YE)
- [`rdn-intake-referral`](skills/rdn-intake-referral/) - Consent-based outbound healthcare nutrition intake that collects structured information for RDN review and referral follow-up. See [`docs/rdn-intake-referral.md`](docs/rdn-intake-referral.md) for documentation and synthetic validation examples.
- [`recall-outreach`](skills/recall-outreach/) - Calls affected customers about a product recall using only organisation-approved wording, routes every unapproved question to a human, and reports call completion and recall resolution as separate measures so a completed call is never counted as a completed return.
- [`kol-ivr-route`](skills/kol-ivr-route/) - Verifies healthcare claim-status phone call results against the question asked, payer-side field evidence, destination identity, and an independent IVR route receipt before downstream use.
- [`pharmacy-cash-price`](skills/pharmacy-cash-price/) - Asks one retail pharmacy for a cash price with no insurance and returns a structured quote, a refusal, or an explicit unknown, with the disclosure and the medical boundary written into the call.
- [`logistics-exception`](skills/logistics-exception/) - Resolves a missed dock window by calling the driver and receiving dock concurrently with one strict CALL-E result schema, reconciling terminal results by event id and re-fetch, combining only reached-contact facts into a recovery card, and gating any dock-changing follow-up call behind explicit human approval.
- [`otherend-task-test`](skills/otherend-task-test/) - Rehearses a CALL-E task text and result schema against a programmable receptionist line the operator owns, reads the deterministic grade (manifest, self-report, fabrication, disclosure, confidence calibration), and turns each failing check into a task-text edit before the task reaches real people.

| [`apps/python/blood-bank-dispatch`](apps/python/blood-bank-dispatch/) | Python | Parallel blood-stock enquiry that dials every blood bank at once on CALL-E, extracts a strict availability schema with `unknown` preserved as an answer, and returns a shortlist for a human to act on. |
| [`apps/python/leash`](apps/python/leash/) | Python | Revokes an unattended agent's Google credential unless one call clears twelve conditions; silence, a machine answering, or a result that disagrees with its own transcript all end the lease. |
| [`apps/typescript/recallready`](apps/typescript/recallready/) | TypeScript | Consent-gated product-recall qualification calls grounded in official CPSC records, with masked destinations, single-use previews, structured remedies, and a no-call default. |
| [`apps/typescript/readyline`](apps/typescript/readyline/) | TypeScript | Event load-in coordinator that turns authorized CALL-E vendor results into deterministic access, dock, power, and deadline checks, with a no-call demo and human-approved follow-up. |
| [`apps/python/freshchain-resolver`](apps/python/freshchain-resolver/) | Python | Resolve delayed cold-chain receiving exceptions by phone and return a safe dispatch decision. |
| [`apps/python/incidentbridge`](apps/python/incidentbridge/) | Python | Consent-first vendor incident support coordinator with masked preview, durable duplicate-call protection, strict structured evidence, and human-owned recovery verification. |
| [`apps/python/hungrycall-cascade`](apps/python/hungrycall-cascade/) | Python | Sequential call cascade that stops at the first candidate meeting every must and boundary, with staged concessions treated as an authorisation and unknown outcomes halting the run. |
| [`apps/python/researchcall-survey`](apps/python/researchcall-survey/) | Python | Standardized survey runner with a reproducible seeded sample, locked ethics rules, raw answers kept beside their coded category, and completion measured against everyone drawn. |
| [`apps/python/ringedingeding`](apps/python/ringedingeding/) | Python | Multi-recipient response aggregator that keeps answered, refused and unreached apart, reports every share against those who answered, and never reads silence as consent. |
| [`apps/typescript/multi-party-scheduler`](apps/typescript/multi-party-scheduler/) | TypeScript | Two-phase appointment scheduling over phone calls: gather availability, confirm one time with everybody by voice, release everybody who confirmed when the commit fails and resume an interrupted run. |
| [`apps/python/callback-coordinator`](apps/python/callback-coordinator/) | Python | Consent-first callback triage and routing: one CALL-E call learns why a person needs a callback, classifies the outcome into a fail-closed disposition, and routes it to the right team. |
| [`apps/python/callback-window-coordinator`](apps/python/callback-window-coordinator/) | Python | Consent-first callback-window coordinator with masked preview, stable idempotency, and structured CALL-E results. |
| [`apps/python/cloud-steward-incident-callback`](apps/python/cloud-steward-incident-callback/) | Python | Preview-first on-call incident notification that preserves Cloud Steward's separate approval boundary. |
| [`apps/python/partline`](apps/python/partline/) | Python | Dry-run-first industrial replacement-part sourcing that calls approved suppliers, checks exact matches against the original request and keeps purchases and alternate approval human-owned. |
| [`apps/python/concord`](apps/python/concord/) | Python | Preview-first branch policy auditing that rules on the value a call extracted rather than the transcript, treats unreached branches and hedged answers as unresolved, and reports on locations rather than staff. |
| [`apps/python/webhook-result-receiver`](apps/python/webhook-result-receiver/) | Python | Durable at-least-once CALL-E terminal webhook ingestion with SQLite deduplication, conflict detection, and authenticated Calls API reconciliation. |
| [`apps/python/lead-follow-up-booking`](apps/python/lead-follow-up-booking/) | Python | Consent-first lead follow-up booking: a disclosed AI call offers only calendar-confirmed free slots and books a Google Calendar event only when the lead picks a time on the call. |
| [`apps/python/callflow-campaign-runner`](apps/python/callflow-campaign-runner/) | Python | CSV-driven outbound campaign runner that triages structured results into auto-closed, retry, and needs-human queues. |
| [`apps/python/mobilize`](apps/python/mobilize/) | Python | Parallel wave dispatch to a consented pool under a deadline: stops calling the moment enough people confirm, and scores how firm each "yes" actually is instead of trusting every stated agreement. Ships a 300-trial zero-cost evaluation harness with a measured accuracy result, a crash-safe ledger, and an MCP server. |
| [`apps/python/batch-runner`](apps/python/batch-runner/) | Python | JSONL batch runner using CALL-E CLI auth state, FastMCP, Rich output, and MCP tool-call metadata. |
| [`apps/python/broker-login-client`](apps/python/broker-login-client/) | Python | CALL-E brokered login client with local token cache and MCP HTTP calls. |
| [`apps/typescript/broker-login-client`](apps/typescript/broker-login-client/) | TypeScript | CALL-E brokered login client using `@call-e/core`. |
| [`apps/typescript/broker-login-client-standalone`](apps/typescript/broker-login-client-standalone/) | TypeScript | CALL-E brokered login client without a shared package dependency. |
| [`apps/python/oauth-login-client`](apps/python/oauth-login-client/) | Python | CALL-E OAuth login client for MCP Streamable HTTP. |
| [`apps/python/metapelet-checkin`](apps/python/metapelet-checkin/) | Python | Preview-first runner for one MetaPelet-style CALL-E check-in with structured post-call summary. |
| [`apps/python/holdfor-board`](apps/python/holdfor-board/) | Python | Post-visit check-in calls to older patients that book nothing: each call returns five bounded answers and one verbatim sentence to a review queue, where a named person grants a bounded authority before a second call carries her own words to the practice's booking line. A reviewer may shorten what she said and never widen it, checked server-side on the exact substring; a red-flag phrase is scanned for deterministically as well as prompted against; and a refusal is filed as a refusal rather than a call to retry. Fake transcripts by default, so the whole board runs without dialling. |
| [`apps/typescript/oauth-login-client`](apps/typescript/oauth-login-client/) | TypeScript | CALL-E OAuth login client for MCP Streamable HTTP. |
| [`apps/typescript/vibehub-founder-relay`](apps/typescript/vibehub-founder-relay/) | TypeScript | Consent-first founder-match readiness call with masked preview, stable idempotency, and structured CALL-E results. |
| [`apps/typescript/openings`](apps/typescript/openings/) | TypeScript | Standing availability watch for care access: calls the healthcare providers actually listed in directories to verify who is real, who takes your plan, and who has an opening, then keeps watching on a decaying cadence until a slot opens. |
| [`apps/typescript/ringer`](apps/typescript/ringer/) | TypeScript | Consumer web app that turns dreaded phone tasks — bill negotiation, cancellations, bookings, refunds, and multi-business quote comparison — into consent-first, multilingual CALL-E workflows with strict per-call and per-recipient result schemas, human-in-the-loop decision authority, evidence-gated and denominator-honest outcomes, and a no-call demo mode by default. |
| [`apps/web/local-atlas`](apps/web/local-atlas/) | JavaScript / Node | Map-first local guide where one confirmed call becomes a dated, evidence-quoted fact every later visitor reuses: stored answers, opinion refusal, closed-business and calling-window checks all work to avoid placing a call at all, results keep their uncertainty and expire by outcome, and private results are written where the public list cannot read them. A comparison across two or three nearby places is one multi-recipient task, with each business answering for itself and the cross-call verdict marked as derived rather than quoted. |
| [`apps/typescript/dispatch-pulse`](apps/typescript/dispatch-pulse/) | TypeScript | Real-time logistics command center for automated pre-delivery recipient phone verification, estate gate code extraction, and live SSE event streaming. |
| [`apps/typescript/sundials`](apps/typescript/sundials/) | TypeScript | Agentic toolchain (embeddable SDK, backend, and dashboard) that helps high-ticket businesses **call while the lead is warm**. Sundials use Goal-oriented CALL-E agents with web interaction context to boost lead conversion. |
| [`apps/python/kept`](apps/python/kept/) | Python | Turns a payment promise made on a collections call into a validated financial record: eleven named rejection reasons stand between a spoken sentence and a ledger entry, vague amounts are refused, over-commitments are clamped to the invoice balance with the spoken figure kept beside them, and the promise is reconciled against the bank feed a week later so only the commitments that actually broke are called again. |
| [`apps/typescript/callsweep`](apps/typescript/callsweep/) | TypeScript | Calls many local businesses, haggles each one down toward your budget on the call, ranks their offers by the best overall deal (price, what's included, availability), and books the one you pick. Dry-run no-call path by default with fictional sample shops. |
| [`apps/typescript/arc-platform`](apps/typescript/arc-platform/) | TypeScript | Approval-gated radio and creator rate calls that read the quoted figure back digit by digit and record nothing as confirmed without a spoken yes; simulated by default when no API key is set, with duplicate-call protection and a masked, published call archive. |
| [`apps/python/casechaser`](apps/python/casechaser/) | Python | Chases an open claim, refund, repair, or delivery case to closure: every company promise becomes a dated, quoted commitment, broken ones climb a fixed escalation ladder, offers and denials stop at the customer, and a masked evidence pack is ready for the written complaint. Fixture mode by default. |
| [`apps/typescript/supplyline`](apps/typescript/supplyline/) | TypeScript | Multi-round freight-rate sourcing agent: sequential CALL-E quote calls to carriers, then a callback to the highest bidder to negotiate against the best competing quote, with a dry-run no-call mode by default. |
| [`apps/web/supplycall-ai`](apps/web/supplycall-ai/) | TypeScript / Next.js | Catalog pointer to SupplyCall AI. Procurement exception recovery: one CALL-E supplier confirmation call, deterministic resolve/escalate rules, shared-number-pool outbound, and Vitest no-call verification. |
| [`apps/typescript/verity-verification-core`](apps/typescript/verity-verification-core/) | TypeScript | Standalone dry-run gate for a CALL-E task's `task_completed` claim: re-reads the transcript with a deterministic grammar, checks the parsed value against what the action would write, requires an in-transcript confirmation and a fresh resource re-check, and returns ALLOW or BLOCK plus a value to re-confirm on a second channel. No calls placed by default; fail-closed. |
| [`apps/python/reality-resolver`](apps/python/reality-resolver/) | Python | Decides whether a call is needed at all before placing one: four generic rules score the evidence for a decision-critical contradiction, a compliance gate applies only the rules that actually apply to the case's use case, and CALL-E's structured result is reconciled back against the original evidence so that voicemail, an IVR, or an unclear answer is escalated for human review rather than actioned as a cancellation. Two use cases ship on the same engine; fake-server dry run by default. |
| [`apps/typescript/navigator-outreach-safety-example`](apps/typescript/navigator-outreach-safety-example/) | TypeScript | Consent-first, fail-closed CALL-E companion demonstrating SDK import, permanent no-call safeguards, fictional mock behavior, and judge-facing evidence boundaries. Live outbound validation is not claimed. |
| [`apps/python/afterword`](apps/python/afterword/) | Python | Death notification to the institutions that have to be told: one call per institution captures the department, the documents, whether a certified copy is accepted and what happens to the direct debits, then returns a single printable pack. Contradictions against a prior call or the recorded policy are marked disputed with both sides kept rather than resolved, a refusal to speak to anybody but the executor is reported as a normal outcome, and the agent can close nothing, cancel nothing and accept nothing. Scripted no-call demo by default. |
| [`apps/python/muster`](apps/python/muster/) | Python | Proof-of-life attestation for pension and benefit schemes: a freshness challenge minted per call that a recording cannot answer, knowledge prompts a housemate should not know, and turn-timing analysis that catches somebody in the room feeding the answers. A relative vouching for the subject is never a pass, no grade ever concludes a death, and nothing it returns can stop a payment. Scripted no-call demo by default. |
| [`apps/typescript/muster-phone-to-report`](apps/typescript/muster-phone-to-report/) | TypeScript | Turns synthetic greenhouse phone reports into evidence-backed readings with a review dashboard, credential-free scenario replay, and an opt-in CALL-E integration. |
| [`apps/python/sticker`](apps/python/sticker/) | Python | Finds out what a prescription actually costs in cash by calling licensed community pharmacies near a ZIP and asking one question, then prices every answer against the national average acquisition cost CMS publishes weekly, so a quote can be judged and not merely compared. Refusals stay in the denominator, a quote for a different bottle size is reported and never rescaled, and discovery never dials: live calls read an explicit per-destination allowlist. Simulated by default. |
| [`apps/python/otherend`](apps/python/otherend/) | Python | Task pre-flight for a CALL-E task: CALL-E dials a programmable line you own that answers as a receptionist with a chosen adversity profile, or as a scripted person for tasks that call people, then a deterministic grader scores what CALL-E reported (`task_completed`, `structured_result`, confidence, AI disclosure) against what the line actually said. Replays nine synthetic rows (in-process simulation, no calls) with no keys by default, including another entry's task text run verbatim; one real call per row only behind `--yes` and an allow-list. |
| [`apps/python/forgegate`](apps/python/forgegate/) | Python | Fail-closed human-verification voice gate for autonomous incident response: calls on-call security leads before critical OT/IT actions execute. Dry-run by default with 35 passing tests. |

- [VERIFY](https://github.com/DivineDomokuma10/verifyam) - Disclosed listing-verification app that calls the agent or landlord behind a rental ad and returns a schema-validated transcript-backed claim (Verified/Warning/Inconclusive) with transcript evidence and an optional mock mode. Verdicts represent transcript-supported assessments, not independent authority verification.

The default e2e tests use a local fake broker/OAuth/MCP server or dry-run paths, so they do not require real CALL-E credentials or browser login. Live verification is opt-in in each app README.

### Community apps

Externally hosted user-facing apps built on CALL-E. They live in their own repositories, so review their setup, credential handling, and call side effects before running them.

- [ProofMesh](https://github.com/fokrulanthro16-eng/proofmesh) - A consent-first CALL-E phone verification platform that turns supervised conversations into auditable, machine-readable facts with human approval, regional controls, and honest uncertainty handling. See the [integration notes](docs/community-apps/proofmesh.md).

### Plugins

No-code and low-code workflow plugins live under [`plugins/`](plugins/). They are for workflow-platform nodes, actions, connectors, and recipes that help operators connect business events to phone-call agent workflows without writing a full app.

Plugins should be explicit about inputs, outbound call side effects, credential handling, preview or dry-run behavior, and how a workflow builder can disable or roll back the integration.

| Plugin | Platform | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`plugins/n8n-calle-api`](plugins/n8n-calle-api/) | n8n | Importable CALL-E API workflow template for one-by-one outbound calls, metadata round trips, call status signals, transcripts, summaries, and structured results. |
| [`plugins/n8n-nodes-calle`](plugins/n8n-nodes-calle/) | n8n | Documentation-only pointer to the standalone `@call-e/n8n-nodes-calle` community node package for native outbound-call nodes. |
| [`plugins/dify-template`](plugins/dify-template/) | Dify | Importable Dify workflow DSL template for a one-shot outbound call tool with dry-run preview, API health gating, and masked results. |
| [`plugins/hubspot-calle`](plugins/hubspot-calle/) | HubSpot | Static HubSpot Projects app for creating CALL-E call tasks from CRM records and workflow App Cards. |
| [`plugins/zapier-calle`](plugins/zapier-calle/) | Zapier | Zapier Platform CLI integration for outbound CALL-E calls with callback-based waiting, fail-closed dispositions, dry-run preview, and payload-derived idempotency keys. |

### Safety patterns

- [`CallSentinel design reference`](docs/call-sentinel/) - Documentation-only concept for advisory phone-call transcript anomaly scoring and a proposed MCP interface; no local application is included.
- [`Production workflow guide`](docs/production-workflows.md) - Application-owned state, stable idempotency, durable webhook processing, result verification, retry ownership, and privacy-minimized audit patterns for consequential phone workflows.
- [`Safety reference`](skills/call-reminder/references/safety.md) - Consent, E.164 phone-number handling, credential boundaries, cancellation, duplicate-job prevention, and medical reminder boundaries.
- [`Dispatch safety reference`](skills/service-dispatch-call/references/safety.md) - Purpose-bound authorization, third-party privacy on outbound calls, the commitment boundary between gathering an answer and accepting it, and retention limits on transcripts and spoken values.
- [`Ambiguous outcome handling`](skills/service-dispatch-call/references/ambiguous-outcomes.md) - Why an unknown call outcome is a state to reconcile rather than an error to retry, and how client timeouts cause duplicate calls.
- [`Idempotency reference`](skills/service-dispatch-call/references/idempotency.md) - Deriving call idempotency keys from the authorization rather than the attempt, reserving before dialling, and replay-safe webhook handling.
- [`Approval threat model`](apps/typescript/phone-approval-gate/docs/threat-model.md) - What a phone approval proves and does not prove, out-of-band secret handling, and why the phone network is a restricted verification channel.
- [`Accept live, verify after`](docs/adr/0007-the-agent-accepts-the-board-checks-the-acceptance.md) - Why an agent may accept an offer while a receptionist waits, and why what it accepted is then read again deterministically against the authorisation that allowed the call, so "only inside the envelope" is a property of the code rather than a request made of a model.
- [`Disclosure budget`](apps/typescript/call-on-behalf/docs/privacy-budget.md) - Authorizing what a caller may say about a person, checking the script before the call and checking what was actually said after it.
- [`Contact-claim limits`](apps/typescript/verify-contact-claim/docs/limits.md) - Why an institution refusing to confirm a contact is the expected outcome, what a confirmed contact still does not prove and what has never been tested live.
- [`Line-ownership verification`](apps/typescript/linecanary/docs/compliance.md) - Why a monitoring tool must prove control of a line before calling it, greeting-token verification, attestation for client lines, and proportionate check frequency.
- [`Provider descriptors`](apps/typescript/voice-preflight/docs/providers.md) - How one HTTP client drives any text-to-speech API from a JSON file, where the audio sits in a response, plus the order in which a run refuses so a failure says what has already happened.
- [`Onboarding call safety`](skills/customer-onboarding-call/references/safety.md) - Consent and recording disclosure, refusal suppression, content boundaries for price and policy claims, working-hours limits, and honest not-reached reporting.
- [`International routing`](skills/customer-onboarding-call/references/international-routing.md) - Forwarding pattern for unsupported regions, distinguishing congestion from no-answer from unsupported destination, and handling providers that report failure then dial anyway.
- [`Calls not placed`](apps/web/local-atlas/docs/calls-not-placed.md) - Refusing before dialling: reusing a stored answer, rejecting questions a phone cannot answer, closed-business and calling-window checks, and defaulting to simulated when no access code is configured.
- [`Fact freshness`](apps/web/local-atlas/docs/fact-freshness.md) - Expiring a call result by outcome so failures are not cached as conclusions, keeping hedges and refusals distinct from answers, and defeating idempotent replay when a reader rechecks.
- [`What a call can establish`](apps/python/muster/docs/what-a-call-can-establish.md) - Separating reachability from identity from the fact you wanted, why a third party vouching is never a pass, scoring challenges in code rather than asking the model to mark its own work, and the asymmetry rule for which error may be automatic.
- [`Design principles`](docs/design-principles.md) - Repository-wide architecture principles for safe phone-call workflows.
- [`Fail-closed dispositions`](plugins/zapier-calle/docs/fail-closed-dispositions.md) - Classifying phone-call outcomes so ambiguity, low confidence, and unrecognized statuses route to a human instead of a success branch.
- [`Rehearse before you act`](docs/rehearse-before-you-act.md) - Why a structured result is a report to verify rather than a fact to act on: rehearsing a task against a scripted counterparty, putting world facts in the task, treating confidence as consistency rather than truth, and checking far-side values against the transcript turn they came from.
